1.  Its the longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary. It means getting a
factitious form of pneumoconiose ,caused by breathing in microscopic 
silicaparticles from volcanos.
2.  Returns resource usage measures for who, which can either be SELF, CHILDREN
or THREAD.
3.  Because this way costs less memory.Also fast load of program.
4.  The for loop gets a word consisting of characters each time it goes through
the for loop. Only alphabetical characters and apostrophes are allowed. This 
character is then added to the array word which will store all the characters to 
form a word. A count(or index) is kept to keep track of how manny characaters there 
are in a word. If the length of a word is larger then the maximum length of a word 
this it goes to the next word. If the word contain numbers it also goes to the next 
word. If the count/index is bigger then 0 an actual word must have been found and 
it is checked for misspellings, if misspelled it is printed.
5.  To make sure no unallowed characters are used, because we use string compare and this
would error with wrong characters.
6.	So if there is a crash there are values for load and check instead of nothing. 
7.  A hash table was implemented with linked lists inside each hash entry. The linked list
contains the word and a pointer to the next linked list in the hash table.
8.  The checking time of check was very large at first. Around 2 seconds to be precise.
9.  The problem I was having was a weak hash value algorithm. When i discovered characters had 
number values assigned to them in C, I used those to calculate better hash values.
10.  The check method is my bottleneck, especially using the larger text files there are more 
collisions and check is slower due to a not optimilazed hash function.
