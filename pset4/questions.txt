0.  Jpeg-24 bit;bmp-1,4,8,16,24,32 bit;gif-8bit;png-24 bit
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  In loss-less,image obtained by decompressing image is identical to initial image which was compressed,but in lossy final and iniitial image are not identical.
3.  jpg
4.  First,it change first characters of directory entry to signal that it has been deleted,second it moves file to free cluster of memory where it remains untouched.
5.  Either by setting each byte to NUL i.e. overwriting is good,however i would prefer using disk sanitization and encryption techniques.
6.  stdint.h is a header file which is set of int type alias having specific width
7.  To store value depending on usage and size of value expected.
8.  Byte:1 byte;Dword:4 byte;long:3 byte;Word:2 byte
9.  42 4D in heaxadecimal
10. bfsize is number of bytes required to store bmp file and bisize is bytes required to store sturcture
11. Negative biHeight has origin of upper left corner
12. biBitCount
13. In case there is not enough memory in heap,so memory isn't allocated.
14. fread here reads structure in bmp,so 1 means here is that we need to read 1 sturucture i.e. bmpinfo or bmpfilehe. 
15. 3
16. fseek helps to take file pointer around the file
17. Seek_Cur sets pointer to current position,means move to position from current position.
